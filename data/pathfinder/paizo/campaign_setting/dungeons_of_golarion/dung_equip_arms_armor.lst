Waraxe (Dwarven).COPY=Deadflesh Waraxe				TYPE:Magic.Cursed	COST:0	EQMOD:Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ Ghost Touch ~ Weapon.Material ~ Mithril ~ Weapon / Item		SOURCEPAGE:p.62																																																																		DESC:Whenever an undead creature is slain with a deadflesh waraxe, the axe allows a portion of the destroyed undead's necromantic energy to flow through the axe and into the wielder's body, causing the wielder to become shaken for 1 minute if he fails a DC 15 Will save. These effects stack with each other-the second time the victim succumbs, he becomes frightened. The third time, he is panicked and drops the deadflesh waraxe in his attempt to flee.
